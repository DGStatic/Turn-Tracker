# Turn-Tracker
A Web App for tracking TTRPG turn-based scenarios.  

In Turn Tracker, you can create, edit, save, load, and delete spreadsheet-like documents for tracking turn-based scenarios in table-top games. Each character can be represented with a row, and each property you wish to track is stored in a cell. Rows and cells can be created, moved around, and deleted. Rows can be duplicated below them to create scenarios quickly. Your scenario is auto-saved so that you can resume where you left off next session.
